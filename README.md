: The executable which runs the program has name "TagStructDriver.exe" and does not take any command line arguments.
: The program consists of a header file, "TagStruct.h", and source files "TagStruct.cpp" "TagStructDriver.cpp".
: The makefile handles all compilation required for the code, along with a clean method to remove all binary files and a run method to run the executable.
: The menu for the executable follows a logical ordering where the options (p,d,l) won't produce meaningful output unless the r option has been used beforehand. The menu also works sequentially where after using an option you have to type "next" into the display in order to use another option.
